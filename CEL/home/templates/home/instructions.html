                This is a “Business” themed Treasure Hunt. Think accordingly!
            </li>
            <li>
                Since this is an Online Treasure Hunt, you are free to roam the virtual world of the internet to search for clues. You may also use your brain to roam around though!
            </li>
            <li>
                Since you have been given the liberty to Google, the problems will tend to be google-proof. You won’t have an easy time cracking most of the clues. Hence, we have decided to give away hints at every step, like charity! But this charity will surely cost
                you something at end because it must be clear that in business everything comes at a price!
            </li>
            <li>
                In order to advance, the team must either give a business concept or an entity-product combination at each level!
            </li>
            <li>
                Even though superficially, in the end, everything is connected!
            </li>
            <li>
                One of the purposes of this event is to instil in you all a certain method of thinking and perceiving your environment. In simple terms, it’s called Lateral Thinking.sed, so that the participants could move further with the questions. Hints will be unveiled
                slowly and order-wise.
            </li>
        </ol>
